This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Once launched the app in vscode run the following script to install all the packages required for this project
```bash
npm init
```


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/login) with your browser to see the result.

*At this stage, you can click on any one of the sign in options without authorization to navigate to the next page. This behaviour is temporary for demonstration purpses and will be replaced with proper authorization as the app develops*
